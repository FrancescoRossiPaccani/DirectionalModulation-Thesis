In this repository, you will find the code and datasets I used to generate the results presented in the file TesiRossiPaccani.pdf.
Some of the uploaded datasets may contain fewer than 10,000 elements, so it is recommended to use the dataGeneration.m script to add more elements if you plan to use them.
The usage of the code is explained in more detail in the aforementioned document.
